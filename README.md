# retropie-fba-configs
A collection of the FBA controller configs I use in RetroPie for Capcom and SNK fighting games.

The most useful part to get from this is simply understanding how FBA maps A, B, X, Y, L, & R to the original arcade buttons.
Here's what that looks like for Capcom and SNK fighting games:

# CAPCOM (6btn layout)
A_=LP <br>  Y_=LK <br>
X_=MP <br>  L_=MK <br>
B_=HP <br>  R_=HK <br>

# SNK (4btn layout)
A_=Arcade-A(WS,LP) <br>  X_=Arcade-B(SS,LK) <br>
B_=Arcade-C(WK,HP) <br>  Y_=Arcade-D(SK/D,HK) <br>

While I have my controls set up with LK & LP on the shoulder buttons, you can customize the configuration however you would like.
